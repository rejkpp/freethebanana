This is the Match Game project for the CodeCademy Ready Web Development Course

I learned to make a memory game and added a few customisations:

– I added 2 levels for a total of 3 (easy, medium, hard)

– I added a "banana" mode, which uses gif images instead of numbers

– I also added a css toggle to change when "banana" mode is enabled

cheers :)
